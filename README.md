## Repos that i'm working in:

### PySpikon

[![PySpikon](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=pyjonhact&repo=pyspikon&theme=gruvbox)](https://github.com/pyjonhact/pyspikon)

#### What is it?

PySpikon is a file-conversion tool for Windows and Unix.

It all started when i wanted to implement ML functions into a .llsp block file. But, different from MakeCode or TinkerCad, Mindstorms doesnt has a build-in converter. Then i've decided to create my own, and here is it. I'm currently trying to do a 'Visual Version' with Electron.js and Brython.

### MSTK

MSTK is an educative open-project that works with LEGO Robotics. It started wuth PySpikon and i now am developing an IDE.
